Week 2: Shell Scripting Practice and Automation for DevOps/SRE

# Shell Scripting Deep Dive 🚀

This repository contains my hands-on learning, exercises, and project scripts as part of my Week 2: **Shell Scripting Deep Dive** in my DevOps/SRE learning path.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Variables and Input
- Conditional Statements
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Functions and Modularity
- Input/Output Redirection
- Script Exit Codes and Error Handling
- `trap` for Cleanup and Safety

## 📁 Structure

| File Name              | Description                                      |

| `hello_user.sh`        | Simple user greeter using variables              |
| `menu_case.sh`         | Menu script using `case`                         |
| `backup_file.sh`       | Back up a file with timestamp                    |
| `check_disk_space.sh`  | Alerts if disk usage crosses a threshold         |
| `redirect_output.sh`   | Demonstrates stdout and stderr redirection       |
| `trap_cleanup.sh`      | Creates temp files and cleans up safely on exit  |
